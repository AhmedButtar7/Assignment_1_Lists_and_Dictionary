# /*Create an Employee Management System (EMS) application that allows us to store and manage employee information# . 
# The application should be able to add new employees# , display employee details, and save employee data to a file for future reference.
# Requirements:
#
# The application should have options to:
# Add a new employee
# Display employee details
# Exit the program
#
#
# Employee details should include:
# Employee ID
# Name
# Position
# Salary
#
# Employee data should be stored in a text file.
#
# When adding a new employee, the user should input the employee details, and the data should be appended to the file.
# When displaying employee details, the program should read the employee data from the file and print it.*/
# Employee Management System (EMS)

# Define the file name to store employee data
